# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Assume the keyword for the program
### Step 2: 
Assing the value of frist variable
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the second variable
### Step 4: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 5: 
print the distance d
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
